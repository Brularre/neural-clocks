## Neural Clocks, Pomodoro Collaboration for Teams

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Hello! If you are reading this, this is a little project I did for practice. This corresponds to the first iteration of a Pomodoro Timer for team collaboration.

In this iteration, it includes a basic layout and functions, with many features planned for the future.

## So what's NC? 

We all experience it, especially those of us who work independently or from home, that time slips through our fingers if we don't know how to manage it efficiently. Combined with distractions, a task that should only take a little while can end up taking the entire day. I know, it has happened to me.

NeuralClocks is a tool that not only supports time management with the well-known Pomodoro technique (i.e., work intervals of 25 minutes with 5-minute breaks that can be stacked for different tasks), but it also allows coordination with colleagues. This coordination can be used for scheduling meetings, synchronizing for pair programming, or other applications.
